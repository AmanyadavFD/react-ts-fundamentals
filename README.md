# React & TypeScript — Basics

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of building React applications using TypeScript.  
It focuses on strong typing, clean component structure, and core React concepts.

## 📌 Project Overview

The app allows users to add course goals via a form and display them in a list.  
It is intentionally simple to clearly showcase React + TypeScript basics.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- React Functional Components
- Props typing with TypeScript
- Event handling (`onChange`, `onSubmit`)
- State management using `useState`
- Controlled form inputs
- Handling user input via Forms
- Creating and using typed data models

## 🧩 Features

- Add a new course goal with title and description
- Display goals dynamically in a list
- Strongly typed components and state
- Clean and scalable folder structure
